I am a Research Assistant Professor at [Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Sciences (NRES)](https://nres.illinois.edu/) and Research Scientist at [Institute for Sustainability, Energy, and Environment (ISEE)](https://sustainability.illinois.edu/) at [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)](https://illinois.edu/). My research focuses on utilizing hyperspectral, thermal and multispectral data collected from manned/unmanned airborne systems, satellites, and proximal sensing to assess vegetation functional traits and ecosystem ecohydrological processes. My overarching research goal is to develop and apply novel sensing techniques with process-based models and data-driven algorithms for crop monitoring and modeling to secure sustainable agriculture.

In the past years, I have designed and tested operational manned/unmanned airborne based monitoring systems to map very high spatial resolution (<1 meter) ecosystem functional traits, nutrients, productivity, water use, soil moisture, energy budget and water use efficiency. Along with sensing techniques, I also use process-based models, machine learning algorithms and field measurements to advance the understanding of key ecohydrological processes across spatial and temporal scales in agricultural and natural ecosystems. Before joining UIUC, I received a Ph.D. degree in environmental engineering from Technical University of Denmark (DTU) in 2019.
